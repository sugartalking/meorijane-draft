these are some of the most frequently asked questions that i got throughout the years. please spare some time to read as what you want to ask me might have been discussed before.
</div>
<div style="max-height: 400px;overflow-y:scroll; margin-bottom:40px;">
<div class="qna" style="margin-top:0px;">
<h4 class="abt">is it possible to commission a paid writing to you?</h4>
yes. however, i can't accept all kinds of commission as it will depend on my ability to execute it.
if you're interested, please approach me on <a href="https://twitter.com/meorijane" target="_blank">twitter</a> 
or via email (<a href="mailto:thatwinterday@gmail.com">thatwinterday@gmail.com</a>) with a clear prompt, and see what we can do from there.
</div>

<div class="qna">
<h4 class="abt">do you write for groups other than enhypen?</h4>
just Red Velvet. and after some careful considerations, this also applies to which characters and pairs i am willing to write for commissioned works.
</div>

<div class="qna">
<h4 class="abt">which enhypen pairs do you write for?</h4>
i write all jungwon ships, heeseung x sunghoon, jay x heeseung, and jay x sunghoon. i simply consider myself incapable of writing ships other than the ones mentioned despite liking and consuming all EN- ships.
</div>

<div class="qna">
<h4 class="abt">i find out that someone plagiarized your work(s), what should i do?</h4>
please report to me privately and let me decide if i want to pursue the issue or not.
</div>

<div class="qna">
<h4 class="abt">are you <i>ever</i> going to continue your abandoned works?</h4>
nobody knows. but some of my works like <a href="https://x.com/meorijane/status/1543847458580865025" target="_blank">deep blu sea</a>
and <a href="https://x.com/meorijane/status/1724766901052789055" target="_blank">call me by my name</a> got updated after a long time of inactivity, so feel free to place your bets.
</div>

<div class="qna">
<h4 class="abt">how did you learn english? you seem to be very good at it and i want to try your methods too.</h4>
i simply had a long time to learn + i was born in the UK + i was chronically online during my formative years. too many freak factors—i don't think I'm the best person to ask regarding this matter.</div>

<div class="qna">
<h4 class="abt">have you heard about <s>this ENHYPEN issue</s>? what do you think about <s>this ENHYPEN issue</s>?</h4>
i probably have heard about <s>certain ENHYPEN issue</s>, but my personal commentaries are reserved to my immediate circle of friends.
so unless i initiate on publicly addressing it (see: <a href="https://x.com/meorijane/status/1743414308409843806" target="_blank">jake apologizing for consuming a product from a zionist-run franchise</a>), then i probably won't

<h4 class="abt"></h4>
</div>

<div class="qna" style="margin-bottom:0px;">
<h4 class="abt">what do you think of LGBT?</h4>
i identify as part of the LGBTQIA+ community, and that includes opposing any TERF narrative.
so please be advised that while i have no interest in online discourse, your trans-exclusionary attitude will not be met with friendliness from my part,
 nor will i entertain any attempt to contest my belief on that.
